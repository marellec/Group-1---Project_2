The app doesn't work when trying to swipe it for the machine to become green and work. It's extremely rare for the app to work in terms of letting students into anywhere with a scanner. If you want to get into any building it not unusual for it to take 40 to 30 tries until it may work or not. Overall I would rate the app an 1/10.

Whoever designed this garbage has no clue what user experience is about. I have hundreds of access points. But I have no idea how this thing sorts the list, alphabetically or numerically. And it keeps refreshing and bouncing back to the top before I can find the access point I am looking for. Need an option to customize frequently used access points.

works about an eighth of the time; then constantly tells me I have to have location services enabled, when they are indeed enabled and working on every single app on my phone except this one apparently. Or, many times it will just say an error has occurred. I've been locked out of my door many times off off and late at night or even locked out of my building which creates a dangerous situation. There is no contact information on the link of phone number no customer service absolutely no one to talk to you. When I call the IT department on my campus they said they had nothing to do with it yet it opens doors on buildings all over this campus.

App doesn't log in. Can't get past the authentication page. I followed the instructions on my school's IT page, but the log in always fails.

This app is the absolute worst. Wish I could give it 0 stars. Since my apartment uses key fobs, this app is my only backup key and it doesn't work. I've been dealing with this issue since April and it's STILL not fixed. Useless. It works on all the doors in the building except for my apartment door, the important one for it to work with. I'm so angry and can't stand the fact that nothing I do or my apartment building does can change the fact that the developer isn't fixing this problem.

Most garbage app I've ever used. Whoever created this should be banned from making apps. I'd give it like a 10% chance of working when you use it. 90% of the time it says "Not in distance of reader" even though I'm right in front of it. Very inconsistent and especially frustrating for ualbany students.

App rarely functions correctly. Will often freeze when trying to use it to open a parking garage gate. Lists of gates are sorted randomly, and change sorting even while scrolling down the list. Can't pin frequently used gates to any sort of favorites list

Works, but lacks many convenience features. We have many doors configured, making it tedious to search for each one. Why not a fast select favorites list? Or even widgets for each door from the home screen?

Very slow to load. Doesn't remember my particular gate. seems to pick a random door or gate on loading. I can get my card out of my wallet and swipe in much faster and more conveniently than using this app.

This app almost never works the first time. It wants wifi enabled then works better without it. It's extremely frustrating and I've given up on it.

Rarely works with location based opening. So far, I have only managed to open a door once with this app, despite constant troubleshooting on my end to ensure location settings are ideal. This is only reliable when you use the code to scan in, not the wifi connected services

Garbage. Takes too long to open and doesn't work most of the time anyway. Says I don't have location services enabled even though I do. Says I'm too far away even when I'm literally right in front of the door. No way to figure out where it thinks I am or where it thinks the door is. Why isn't it NFC based?

The last update for this app was in 2018 and it still has the interface of an app from the early 2000's. Looks pretty bad and doesn't really work.

Does what it says it will do ! It's a secure way to access campus buildings and residence at my university. It's also location-based, so when I go to a new place it automatically updates. Thankful for this app that allows me to get back to my apartment with just my phone ! üòÉüòÉüëèüëè

Completely worthless app that never works. Of course the devs don't care because all that matters to them is that they got our school's money - who cares about the app actually doing what it says? If this cost money to purchase it would be fraud plain and simple.

One time my roommate was locked out of his bedroom in his underwear and his roommate for his bedroom was about 3 hours away. I called him and he used this app to open room for him so he could get some pants on. I fully recommend this app.
