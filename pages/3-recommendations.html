        <h1>Recommendations</h1>
        <p>We propose these changes are made to the user interface to improve usability of the CBord app:</p>

        <!-- what needs to change AND 
            detail how those changes will 
            BENEFIT USABILITY on the site  -->

        <ol>
        <li><strong>Prioritize query in door search feature and alphabetize doors by name.</strong> 
            It has been noted that users have trouble finding doors quickly and must spend time scrolling through an unsorted list of doors to find the correct one. 
            Users are unable to search properly because the search feature keeps doors unrelated to the query in the list and jumps users down to the first matching query. 
            Once a search is made, it moves recent searches to the top, which forces the user to scroll for all other queries beginning with the same letters (such as in the same building).
            We propose ordering the list alphabetically and removing doors in real time as the user types their query to improve the search feature.
            This will have the greatest impact on usability because the function of the app is to open specific doors, which is made extremely tedious and at times impossible by the current UI design (depending on how long the list is and haw far the correct door is from the top, scrolling may not work).
        </li>

        <li><strong>Allow users to continue without Wifi prompt.</strong> 
            The current Wifi prompt stops users in the middle of their activities asking them to connect to Wifi, which is not a necessity for using the app. The yes/no buttons both fail to let the user continue uninterrupted or change their Wifi settings. 
            We propose making this pop-up only appear once, as it is useful as an initial warning that Wifi may be a better connection.
            However, the pop-up should not reappear after the no button is clicked within the same user session. 
            If it is possible to turn on the user's Wifi, we also recommend making the yes button 
            Users will appreciate removing this inconvenience as they need to open doors quickly, which the pop-up prevents.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Add local device password/fingerprint user authentication.</strong> 
            Users are forced to sign in to the app repeatedly because the app does not store the user's credentials locally for an extended period.
            We recommend keeping track of this data on the user's device so that they can enter their device login, whether a password or a fignerprint authentication.
            Because users are on their personal devices, signing in with their device provides the same level of security as logging in to the server again.
            Giving users the convenience of a single authentication will allow users to enjoy simple future sign-ins.
        </li>
        </ol>
